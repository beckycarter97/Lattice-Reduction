# Lattice-Reduction

This code was produced during a summer project on Methods to Solve the Shortest Vector Problem, which I completed under the supervision of Dr Ali El Kaafarani at the University of Oxford.

The results for runtimes etc. were obtained using the fplll lattice reduction library, with input of bases from the SVP challenges on the Darmstadt Lattice challenge site.
